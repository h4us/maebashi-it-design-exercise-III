 *      - Cameas
 *      - Transform nodes
 *
 * You can extend the desired class according to the node type.
 * Example:
 *      export default class MyMesh extends Mesh {

 * The function "onInitialize" is called immediately after the constructor is called.
 * The functions "onStart" and "onUpdate" are called automatically.
